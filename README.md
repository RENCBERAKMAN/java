This project was created during my Java learning journey to establish a structure where operation files and input-output processes are kept in separate files, allowing each file to be tested independently.

Although it is a simple project, it is designed as an effective example for practicing writing tests and getting accustomed to testing. This way, I gain the experience of verifying each component separately and enhancing my learning process.
