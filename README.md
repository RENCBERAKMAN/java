This project was created to help me understand the principles of modular programming and get accustomed to microservices architecture during my Java learning journey.

My goals:

Learn the single responsibility principle by defining each operation in separate files

Understand the concept of handling only input and routing through the Main class

See how independently functioning components can be integrated with each other

With this simple structure, I aim to build a solid foundation for transitioning to large-scale microservices projects in the future.
